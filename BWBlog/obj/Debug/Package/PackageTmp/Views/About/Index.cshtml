            <p class="lead">I grew up in Lexington, KY, the horse capital of the world. I later moved to a small town called Danville, KY, where I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree from Centre College. The week after graduating I moved to Louisville, KY, where I landed my first full-time job and met my partner, Trent.</p>
            <p class="lead">My mom is an amazing cook, and I tried my best to learn to cook a fraction as well as her. Trent and I now live in Greensboro, NC, where we take care of an adorable beagle called Petey; we are always becoming better dog parents. Many of my experiences have taught me to actively engage in life, regardless of time or place.</p>
